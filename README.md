# SICP Learning Note

An [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) learning note and solution.

Please read note.md, or note.html, the prebuilt HTML.  
index.txt lists what those `*.rkt`, `*.scm`, `*.py` contain;
 they are basically solutions of the exercises from the book.
